### Getting started with GitHub Pages
#### Confirm you are in your repository
> You should now be on a page for your repository.
> - The URL for mine is: [https://github.com/shaunweg/hello-web](https://github.com/shaunweg/hello-web)
> - Yours should look similar

> There should be a fair number of things on the page. 

***
> At the very top:
> - the overhead menu for all of GitHub on a dark background

> Below that:
> - your username and repository name
> - a horizontal menu, currently set on <> Code, notice Settings at the end
> - your repository description, if you made one
> - a horizontal content box, showing:
    - 1 commit, 
    - 1 branch, 
    - 0 releases, and 
    - 1 contributor
> - a few buttons laid out horizontally
> - a content box stating you made the initial commit
> - a README.md
