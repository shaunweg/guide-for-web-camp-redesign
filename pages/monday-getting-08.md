### Getting started with GitHub Pages
#### Edit the README.md file
> To do this, you need to **go back** to your *repository page*
> - the URL for mine is: [https://github.com/shaunweg/hello-web](https://github.com/shaunweg/hello-web)
> - Yours should be similar

***
> **Click** the *README.md* file name that is in blue

> On the page that loads, a few lines down,

> you should see a horizontal content bar that says the # of lines, the # of bytes,

> and on the far right, there's a few buttons and icons.

***
> **Click** the *pencil* icon.

> You can see the page is created with very little information.

> This file uses *Markdown*, thats what the *.md* in the *file name* stands for

> Try **adding** some new lines of text to the *Markdown* file.

***
> This is *NOT* html. 

> *GitHub* will take the markdown and transform it into the web languages

> allowing your browser to read it.

***
> When you are done, **scroll down** to the bottom, you should see a box that says:
> - *Commit changes*

> with a few boxes below it, put in a brief comment about the changes you made.

> Then **click** *Commit changes*.
