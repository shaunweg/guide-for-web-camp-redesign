### Getting started with GitHub Pages
#### Add a theme
> Your *Hello Web* page probably looks pretty plain

> However, this page here looks much nicer, 

> even though it is also created in *GitHub Pages* with *Markdown*.

> The difference is, this page is in a repository with a theme.

***
> **Go back** to your *repository page*, and **click** *setting* on the right side

> **Scroll down** to where we found GitHub Pages, and **click** *Choose* a theme

> There's a handful of different themes you can select.

> Choose which ever you like best.

***

> In your repository, you'll notice a new file:
> - _config.yml
> This file tells GitHub Pages what styles to use with your page.
