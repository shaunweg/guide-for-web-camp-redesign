### Getting started with GitHub Pages
#### Think about Design.
> What do you think about my page?

> It looks nice enough right?

> but how was it, as far as being a user?

> This is the second version of it.

> Check out last year's version of it [here.](https://shaunweg.github.io/guide-for-web-camp/)

> Which is better? Is it better with:
> - more pictures? With pictures helping guide you instead of just words?
> - a different theme? Maybe others would have worked better?
> - content split across multiple pages? or would a really long page be better?
