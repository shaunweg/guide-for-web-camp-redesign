### Getting started with GitHub Pages
#### **Create** a *[GitHub](https://github.com)* account

> [https://github.com](https://github.com)

> When you create your account

> you'll have a few things to **fill out**

![Image of GitHub.com](images/git02.jpg)

> On the next page, you can **fill** these out

> or just **click** *skip this step* at the bottom.

***

#### **Go** to your Profile

> At the top of the page you should see a dark bar

> it contains several links, and at the far right

> it includes a little square with a white triangle pointing down.

> **Click** the *white triangle*

> **Click** *Your Profile*

***

#### On your Profile, you should see
> At the very top:
> - the overhead menu for all of *GitHub* on a dark background

> On the left:
> - a graphic of oversized pixels
> - your username
> - a couple buttons you can check out later

> On the right:
> - a horizontal menu
> - more content, like: 
>   - an empty box about repositories and 
>   - a grid based calendar

***
> In the overhead menu on the right side, **click** repositories

> then **click** the green "New" button

***

#### **Create** and **Initialize** a New Repository
> **Choose** a name, I used "hello-web" as mine
> - If you aren't sure what to call yours, you can use the same name

> **Add** a *description*

> *Public* is fine, *private* requires a subscription

> **Click** the checkbox to *Initialize this repository*
> - This isn't required, you can manually do it, but its a lot more work
> - Lets do it the easier way.

***

#### Confirm you are in your repository
> You should now be on a page for your repository.
> - The URL for mine is: [https://github.com/shaunweg/hello-web](https://github.com/shaunweg/hello-web)
> - Yours should look similar

> There should be a fair number of things on the page. 

***
> At the very top:
> - the overhead menu for all of GitHub on a dark background

> Below that:
> - your username and repository name
> - a horizontal menu, currently set on <> Code, notice Settings at the end
> - your repository description, if you made one
> - a horizontal content box, showing:
    - 1 commit, 
    - 1 branch, 
    - 0 releases, and 
    - 1 contributor
> - a few buttons laid out horizontally
> - a content box stating you made the initial commit
> - a README.md

***

#### Go to the Settings of your Repository
> In the horizontal menu below your username and repository name, **click** *Settings*

***

#### Enable Github Pages
> You'll find it toward the bottom of the page.

> To enable, **click** the button that reads *None*, and change it to *master branch*.

> **Click** the *Save* button next to it

***

#### Confirm your GitHub Page is working!
> If you **click** *save*, a green content box should provide you the URL
> - The URL for mine is: [https://shaunweg.github.io/hello-web/](https://shaunweg.github.io/hello-web/)
> - Yours should look similar.

***
> **Try** it, make sure it works.

> The content you should see is what was in the README.me file.

> We can change what it shows by changing the README.me file,

> or by uploading a new one.  

***

#### Edit the README.md file
> To do this, you need to go back to your repository page
> - the URL for mine is: [https://github.com/shaunweg/hello-web](https://github.com/shaunweg/hello-web)
> - Yours should be similar

***
> **Click** the *README.md* file name that is in blue

> On the page that loads, a few lines down,

> you should see a horizontal content bar that says the # of lines, the # of bytes,

> and on the far right, has a few buttons and icons.

***
> **Click** the *pencil* icon.

> You can see the page is created with very little information.

> This file uses *Markdown*, thats what the *.md* in the *file name* stands for

> Try **adding** some new lines of text to the *Markdown* file.

***
> This is *NOT* html. 

> *GitHub* will take the markdown and transform it into the web languages

> allowing your browser to read it.

***
> When you are done, **scroll down** to the bottom, you should see a box that says:
> - *Commit changes*

> with a few boxes below it, put in a brief comment about the changes you made.

> Then **click** *Commit changes*.

***
> To see more things you can do with markdown,

> check out: [https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

> or this one: [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

***

#### Add a theme
> Your *Hello Web* page probably looks pretty plain

> However, this page here looks much nicer, 

> even though it is also created in *GitHub Pages* with *Markdown*.

> The difference is, this page is in a repository with a theme.

***
> **Go back** to your *repository page*, and **click** *setting* on the right side

> **Scroll down** to where we found GitHub Pages, and **click** *Choose* a theme

> In your repository, you'll notice a new file:
> - _config.yml
> This file tells GitHub Pages what styles to use with your page.

***

#### Try viewing your GitHub page again.
> How's it look?

> You can go back to settings and try other styles if you want

> or add more content to your page

> Try new markdown tags from the Markdown Cheatsheet I provided earlier

> What do you want your GitHub Page to be about?

> Redesign it to be about something you are interested in.

> Want to see the Markdown for this page?
> - **Scroll Up** to the top of the page and
> - **Click** *View the Project on GitHub*

***

#### Think about Design.
> What do you think about my page?

> It looks nice enough right?

> but how was it, as far as being a user?

> This is the second version of it.

> Check out the first version of it, [here.](https://shaunweg.github.io/guide-for-web-camp/)

> Which is better? Is it better with:
> - more pictures? With pictures helping guide you instead of just words?
> - a different theme? Maybe others would have worked better?
> - content split across multiple pages? or would a really long page be better?
