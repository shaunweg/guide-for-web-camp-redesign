### 2018 Summer Code Camp
# Web Design

#### Monday

> We are going to start the camp with creating a basic webpage on GitHub.

> There are many ways to build a webpage. This is just one.

> As we get further into the course, we'll look at web languages including:
> - HTML
> - CSS
> - JS

> Since we are starting with GitHub, maybe we should learn a bit about it...
