#### Check out CSS Zen Garden

> Go to the [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com)

> On the right side, you can select a few highlighted designs

> Or click View All Designs.

> These different designs are just created with CSS,

> The HTML for each of these pages for is the exact same

***

> Try downloading the HTML & CSS, 

> copy and paste the code into Repl.it or GitHub

> and experimenting with it.

***

#### Try a bit of JavaScript

> We aren't going to get super extensive into JavaScript

> because designing the visuals of your page doesn't require it.

> However, you should give it a try to understand how it works.

> Javascript actually is a programming language, unlike HTML and CSS.

> Try a few simple JS tutorials:
> - [JavaScript Alerts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAXBrWPhuzs)
> - [Alerts with Buttons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDBnxGWlgVA)
> - [Using Simple Prompts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdl8s3GMc0A)

#### Start coding your design

> Lets start chaning your idea from design into code

> Doing so will probably focus mostly on working with,

> of perhaps fighting with, CSS.

> Its hard at the start, but the more you play with it,

> the more you'll get the hang of it.
