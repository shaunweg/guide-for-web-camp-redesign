**Sketch an Idea** 

> You've already built a page with GitHub Pages.

> You've also started working a bit with HTML.

> As we move into CSS, you probably want to have a plan on what you want to build.

> Before we move further, discuss ideas with someone near you.

***

> Once you think you have an idea you want to develop,

> think about how you want it to look.

> What layout would work well for what you want to build?

> How do you want it to look?

> Sketch out a plan for your website.

> We'll use this plan as we continue.
