**Sketch an Idea** 

> First, go to [Repl.it](https://repl.it).

> In the top left of your browser, click Sign Up.

***

> From the drop down menu, there are your expected boxes.

> However, notice the little icons about that?

> However, you can also sign up using: 
> - a Google Account
> - a GitHub Account
> - a Facebook Account

***

> See the black circle with the cat in it?

> Click it to sign up with GitHub.

> After authorizing, you'll see a screen with a box at the top.

> Repl.it isn't just for HTML, you can work with tons of different languages in it.

> In that box, type in HTML to start creating an HTML document in Repl.it

***

> On the screen, you'll see a series of panels.

> In the middle panel, there's already a chunk of code.

> In this section, you can start modifying the code. 

***

> Try adding something between the body tags.

> Once you've modified the code, click the run button.

> Try making a page with the code.
