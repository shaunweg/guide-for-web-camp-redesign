**Intro to CSS** 

> The next web language to look at is CSS

> HTML is what you use to create the content

> If you have a website about cats, the HTML is the content, 

> it tells the browser what to load, including:
> - text
> - photos
> - links

> HTML doesn't tell the browser how it should look though.

> CSS is what tells the browser how it should look.

> If a webpage looks nice, its because of CSS.
