**Intro to CSS** 

> The next web language to look at is CSS

> HTML is what you use to create the content

> If you have a website about cats, the HTML is the content, 

> it tells the browser what to load, including:
> - text
> - photos
> - links

> HTML doesn't tell the browser how it should look though.

> CSS is what tells the browser how it should look.

> If a webpage looks nice, its because of CSS.

> Watch this explanation on HTML, CSS, and JS.

> There are multiple ways we can start understanding CSS.

> The easiest way to start, is probably by adding style tags directly into our HTML page.

> Follow along with this video.

***

> The main idea of CSS is not to do it inline though...

> Its to have an external file that connects to your HTML pages.

> Repl.it automatically attaches an esternal CSS to your page.

> Check out [this example](https://repl.it/@shaunweg/DoubleLightcoralDeprecatedsoftware) with a gradient background.

> The code for it is created in CSS, and viewable in the CSS file.

> Follow along as I create a button with HTML & CSS
