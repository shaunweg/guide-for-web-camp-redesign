> Repl.it isn't just for HTML, you can work with tons of different languages in it.

> In that box, **type in** *HTML* to start creating an HTML, CSS, & JS document in Repl.it

**Intro to CSS** 

> The next web language to look at is CSS

> HTML is what you use to create the content

> If you have a website about cats, the HTML is the content, 

> it tells the browser what to load, including:
> - text
> - photos
> - links

> HTML doesn't tell the browser how it should look though.

> CSS is what tells the browser how it should look.

> If a webpage looks nice, its because of CSS.

***

> **Watch** this *explanation on HTML, CSS, and JS*.

> video: [HTML, CSS, JavaScript Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78)

***

> There are multiple ways we can start understanding CSS.

> The easiest is probably adding style tags directly into our HTML page.

> **Follow** along with *this video*.
